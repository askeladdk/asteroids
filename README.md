# Asteroids

I made this Asteroids clone to practice with programming and more importantly finishing a simple game from start to finish. The game has a little physics engine that controls the movement of the game objects and causes asteroids to richochet when they bump into each other.

## How to play

The objective is to destroy all asteroids in the level. When an asteroid is destroyed it splits into four pieces of debris that must also be destroyed. When all asteroids and debris is destroyed you continue to the next level.

The higher your score, the greater your internet cred.

Every destroyed asteroid gains you 100 points. Every destroyed piece of debris gains you 25 points. Every bullet fired costs you 5 points, so aim before you fire.

## Controls

* Press SPACE to fire bullets.
* Press UP or W to thrust.
* Press Left/Right or A/D to turn.
* Press Escape to quit.
